    <h1>Autosuggesting input sample implementation</h1>
    <p>
      Input / select crossover components cover a whole spectrum between the two:
      on the one end, they act as a “searchable select“, where the user can only select
      an option from the list. On the opposite side, the user is free to input whatever
      she wishes, and the hints only provide assistance.
    </p>
    <p>
      Since the intended use case was not specified, I've made up one of book search.
      I opted for a balanced UX where the options are highly suggested, but not enforced.
      The free-form search with no option selected is useful when the backend implements a lighter
      search algorithm for suggestions, and employs full-text search over the books with
      a focused search functionality.
    </p>
    <p>
      The component is fairly usable for mouse-, touch- and keyboard-centered users, albeit 
      far from perfect. Further use cases can be covered by providing grouped search — for example, 
      a separate section of results applies to the categories, like “thriller” or “romance”. I 
      have decided not to implement such advanced functionality, and instead focus on the 
      core implementation.
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>Note on time taken:</b>
      The React implementation with all the UX research took about 4 hours. The standalone 
      component took another hour, as did this accompanying text.
    </p>

    <h2>React implementation notes</h2>
    <p>
      <b>General disclaimer:</b> I'd much rather use a commodity react component, such as
      <a href="https://github.com/moroshko/react-autosuggest">react-autosuggest,</a>
      since they are more used, robust and battle-tested than a custom implementation.
    </p>
    <p>
      Base Autocomplete component provides a low-level controlled API, intended for use in
      a layered API, as shown in BookSelector. The middle-lever wrappers are best written 
      using HOCs, such as react-redux and recompose. I have only rolled my own data management
      layer for illustrative purposes. 
    </p>
    <p>
      I'm not satisfied with the option flickering on first-time search,
      but eliminating it would introduce high statefulness into the 
      component, which should be done with extreme care. For the first iteration, 
      this aspect should be fine.
    </p>
    <p>
      Styles are written in SASS without CSS modules. Namespacing is achieved via BEM-style
      naming. This approach provides easy reuse in pure-js variant and low-tech style overrides.
    </p>

    <h2>Pure JS implementation notes</h2>
    <p>
      I have gone a step further and not just built a pure-js version, but also one with no-js
      fallback. While the base HTML is written inline, in production settings it would be best 
      encapsulated into a backend-templating component (pug, handlebars, blade or whatever).
      Overall, I have not had the time to test all the options and flows thoroughly, but the
      basic functionality should be fine.
    </p>
    <p>
      The rendering implementation is naïve and re-renders the option list on every action.
      This stage could benefit from a standalone virtual DOM library, such as snabbdom.
    </p>
    <p>
      I achieved a fair share of code parity between standalone and React implementations.
      There is opportunity for code reuse between the two, but a generic 
      implementation is completely aside the matter.
